Postcast is a new way to teach and learn by creating content in a video-like way without the cost of producing a video.

## Benefits

Some core benefits are:

- Easy to create and update.
- Multiple languages including examples are easy as translating a post.
- Searchable content.
- Links and all web goodies just works.
- Interactive.


## Introduction

This **PostCast** will teach you how to get started producing your own _guide_.

To start creating a `PostCast`, just create a markdown file like `first-post.md`.

```shell

touch first-post.md

```

Then open the file in an editor. Use this content as an example.

```md
# This is a title

And this paragraph will be used with text to Speech.


```

This example will produce a video showing the title. The paragraph content will be spoken over the title and captioned to be read.
